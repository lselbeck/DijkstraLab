# DijkstraLab
An implementation of Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm using graphs.  Input your data into the data text files, and this program will run Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from one node to the rest.

Uses two edge/node graphs which each store a map of the data.  GraphM is implemented with arrays, and GraphL is implemented with lists.

To compile:
g++ lab3.cpp graphl.cpp graphm.cpp nodedata.cpp
